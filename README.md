# dotfiles

Opinionated and largely clueless dotfiles with some setup for the following things:

* fish 
* i3wm
* git
* ruby/rbenv
* autojump

Stuff shamelessly stolen and edited from everywhere.
Most of all from the excellent [prezto](http://github.com/sorin-ionescu/zpresto) that I leave behind for [fish](http://fishshell.com/).

Intended for use with ThoughtBot's [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)
