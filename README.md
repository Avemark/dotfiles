# dotfiles

Opinionated and largely clueless dotfiles with some setup for the following things:

* fish
* i3wm
* git
* ruby/rbenv
* autojump
* compton
* urxvt
* rofi
* spotify

Stuff shamelessly stolen and edited from everywhere.
Most of all from the excellent [prezto](http://github.com/sorin-ionescu/zpresto) that I leave behind for [fish](http://fishshell.com/).

Intended for use with ThoughtBot's [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)

expected utility applications:
amixer (deb package alsa-utils)
feh

.misc/xkb_symbols_se_colemak is an addition meant for /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se that includes my colemak keymap
